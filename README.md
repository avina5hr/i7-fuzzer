## LIVE555 Code Fuzzing
The `live555_fuzzer.py` script is the main fuzzing tool used to test the Live555 RTSP server. It works by sending both unmutated and mutated RTSP messages to the server, monitoring its responses, and analyzing code coverage to detect potential vulnerabilities.

## üéØ Sending Messages to the Server
- The script first sends an **unmutated RTSP message**.
- Then, it sends a **mutated RTSP message** to test the server.
- After sending a mutated message, the script waits for a response from the server.

## üìä Code Coverage Collection
- After processing the mutated message, the script resends the unmutated message to compare responses.
- The **code coverage data** is then dumped into the specified directory.

## üí• Crash Detection
- The script monitors the server‚Äôs response and logs it.
- If a crash occurs, the fuzzer logs the failure for further analysis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Before Running the Fuzzer
Before running `live555_fuzzer.py`, the user must configure key parameters related to the **server, message storage, and coverage output** as shown in Table 1. These parameters ensure that the fuzzer runs correctly and collects the necessary data.

# üõ†Ô∏è Mutation & Filtering

This repository contains scripts for generating and filtering **mutated RTSP messages** for fuzz testing. The mutation process includes **insertion** and **replacement** techniques, affecting **1 to 5 bits** in each message. LSTM-based neural network predicts the **code coverage probability** of each mutated message, allowing for intelligent filtering.

## üìú Scripts Overview

### 1. `mutation.py`
- Generates **mutated RTSP messages** by applying:
  - **Insertion**: Randomly adding new bits within the message.
  - **Replacement**: Replacing existing bits with new values.
- Each mutation affects **1 to 5 bits** per message.
- Saves all mutated messages in a designated directory for further processing.

### 2. `nn_mutation.py`
- Uses a **trained LSTM neural network** to evaluate mutated messages.
- Predicts the **code coverage probability** of each mutation.
- Messages with low-probability than threshold are discarded.

## üîß `nn_mutation.py` Configuration

### Parameters

| Parameter               | Explanation |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| `INPUT_DIR`            | Directory containing original (unmutated) RTSP messages. |
| `MUTATION_DIR`         | Directory where mutated messages (1-5 bit changes) are stored. |
| `FILTERED_OUTPUT_DIR`  | Directory where NN-filtered mutated messages are saved. |
| `SAVE_MODEL_PATH`      | Path to the trained LSTM model used for prediction. |
| `PREDICTIONS_CSV`      | Path to a CSV file storing predicted **code coverage probabilities** for each mutation. |
| `THRESHOLD`            | Probability threshold for filtering mutations based on coverage impact. |

---

## ‚ö° How It Works
1. **Mutation Process**: `mutation.py` generates RTSP mutations with small bit-level modifications.
2. **Prediction**: `nn_mutation.py` loads the LSTM model to predict the probability of improved **code coverage**.
3. **Filtering**: Only mutations exceeding the probability threshold are saved.

This approach ensures efficient mutation generation while prioritizing **mutations with a higher chance of increasing code coverage**, making fuzz testing more effective.

---

# üèπ `state_selection_fuzzer.py`
The `state_selection_fuzzer.py` script is responsible for implementing state-aware fuzzing strategies. It selects specific RTSP message sequences based on state transitions and previous responses to maximize code coverage and vulnerability discovery.

## üöÄ State-Aware Fuzzing
- Reads unmutated RTSP messages and state transition data from `OUTPUT_DIR`.
- Selects a message and applies a mutation based on a defined strategy (e.g., probability-based, state-based).
- Sends the mutated message to the RTSP server.
- Monitors server responses for crashes and unexpected behavior.

## üéØ State Selection Strategies
The script supports three state selection strategies to control which RTSP message sequence to mutate and send to the server:

### 1. üé≤ Weighted State Selection (selection = "1")
- The probability of selecting a state is based on the number of transitions from that state.
- States with more transitions are more likely to be selected.

### 2. üîÑ Round-Robin State Selection (selection = "2")
- The script selects states in a cyclic (round-robin) order.
- This ensures that every state is tested uniformly over time.

### 3. üé≤ Uniform Random State Selection (selection = "3")
- The script selects a state randomly with equal probability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Before Running `state_selection_fuzzer.py`

# üõ∞Ô∏è MQTT Fuzzing Configuration

This repository contains scripts for fuzz testing an MQTT server using a neural network-based mutation approach. The fuzzer modifies MQTT messages to discover vulnerabilities and enhance test coverage.

## üìú Scripts Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `nn_mutation.py`
This script mutates MQTT messages with the help of a **neural network (NN) model** that predicts mutation probabilities.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Parameters

| Parameter             | Explanation |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `INPUT_DIR`       | Directory containing original MQTT messages for mutation. |
| `MUTATION_DIR`    | Directory where mutated MQTT messages are stored. |
| `FILTERED_OUTPUT_DIR` | Directory for messages that pass NN filtering (based on probability thresholds). |
| `SAVE_MODEL_PATH` | Path to the trained NN model weights used for mutation prediction. |
| `PREDICTIONS_CSV` | CSV file where mutation probabilities are stored. Helps prioritize fuzzing. |
| `THRESHOLD`      | Probability threshold for filtering mutations. Mutations below this threshold are discarded. |

---
